- Install Java SDK 1.6

- All jars used in the examples are included in the 'jars' directory.

- The examples can be ran from 'runtest.sh' on Unix and 'runtest.bat' on
  Windows.

NOTE FOR MAVEN USERS:

  A pom file is included for building with Maven.  It requires the
  browsermob proxy project to be built on your local machine (the proxy is
  currently not in the Nexus central repo).  Instructions on how build the
  proxy can be found on the browsermob-proxy github page:

    https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy/

========
Examples
========

Each example builds on the previous.  It is easiest to follow along by
examining one at a time.  Modify as needed to test your own site.

To run a test case (for example TestClassName):

Unix:

  sh runtest.sh TestClassName

Windows:

  runtest.bat TestClassName


This will compile and run the test case all in one go.

The test cases are as follows:

Part 1: Selenium setup

  BasicSelenium - Example of using Selenium in a JUnit test

  PageLoadTime  - Selenium test with asserts for page load times.

Part 2: Using the proxy to capture metrics

  HarCapture    - Capture har, screenshot and error message and store to the
                  'logs' directory.

  Whitelist     - Example of whitelisting URLs to test the page load time
                  excluding 3rd party content.

  Bandwidth     - Example of setting the proxy bandwidth limit

  UploadHAR     - Upload har, screenshot and error message to Harpoon
